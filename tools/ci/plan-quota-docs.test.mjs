// AGENTS.md tells every agent to read `.agents/features/<name>.md` before changing a
// module and to trust it for "entities, services, and integration details". A doc that
// claims a guard is wired to a call path it does not have sends the next agent looking for
// an enforcement that does not exist — that is how #20's `checkActiveFlowsExceededLimit`
// came to be documented as "called when enabling/publishing flows" with zero call sites.
//
// This guards the platform-plan quota surface specifically. The scan is not repo-wide on
// purpose: `.agents/features/workers.md` makes a similar unverified claim about
// `primeFullContainerMemory`, which is a separate defect and is tracked on its own issue.
